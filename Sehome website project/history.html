        <h2>History</h2>
        <p>
            The arboretum first began as a spot for coal mining and logging. Henery Roeder's lumber mill
            did their logging business in the 1850s, and was the only facility to run on the arb. Until 
            two employees from the logging business, Henry Hewitt and William Brown, found coal in the 
            area. They later started up the Bellingham Bay Coal Company in 1855.  
        </p>
        <p>
            The arb officially became a park in 1922, and a tunnel was made later for cars to drive 
            through when cars had access to go up the hill.
